# Cookie House Sample Project
The Cookie House sample project is a collection of pre-made Fides YAML configuration files that represent the systems, datasets and policies for the Cookie House sample project.

These resources are designed for use with the Cookie House Project to learn the core concepts of Fides resource management. 

For more information on managing resources in Fides read the [developer docs](https://fid.es/dev-docs).
